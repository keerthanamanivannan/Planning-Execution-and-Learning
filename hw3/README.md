Question: Write two planners, one should find the optimal solution of the 
robot and the target in the given time, when the target starts moving, the 
other planner should find a suboptimal solution, but the algorithm
should converge in lesser time than the first planner

Qn 1a. Optimal solution:

Running instructions: print the following command in the terminal
./a.sh problem_1.txt 1
Note: 1 is the weight - this will run Astar - which is always optimal

Qn 1b. Suboptimal solution:

Running instructions: print the following command in the terminal
./a.sh problem_1.txt 5
Note: 5 corresponds to the weight that A star is blew up to
